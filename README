Multiple file uploader, used here for Butter Music's Content Distribution System.

SETUP:

sudo rake gems:install

sudo gem install ruby-mp3info
(mp3-info needs to be installed on the server running this, but is not required in environment.rb)

sudo gem install aws-s3
(also required on the host server, not in the environment)

rake db:migrate

Should be good to go.

A note on deploying this to Heroku:

The gems on the manifest include the aws-s3 gem, but this is not required in the environment.rb file. DON'T REQUIRE IT THERE. It will break. Keep everything exactly as is. The aws-s3 gem needs to be installed on the server, but does not need to be required in the environment.rb file.
